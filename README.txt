Welcome to Repositories in a Bucket!

Every once in a while, I pull a repository from the bucket.
Old repositories that I have picked repositories will be equally likely to be picked.
New repositories (1st 2 times picked) will have 3 times the chance to be picked.

When I take that repository, I conribute to it.
You can find the times that it's scheduled to happen in schedule.txt.

To enter a repository, read README_entries.txt.

Some projects that, quoteonquote, "need my help" are automatically entered unless Manual Only is set to true. These repositories can be found
  in auto.txt.

In order for your account to be checked for WillboxMattewRepositoriesInABucket, this repository must be starred. Once your name is registered,
  you can unstar. To have your account pulled from the list, delete the repository.

Any contributed repositories will be in mentions.txt.

I'm probably going to hold out on this a long time, but at least you'll be prepared.
